1.    Data Preparation:
        Collect and annotate a dataset of images containing mugs with ETH Zurich labels.
        Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

 2.   Model Design:
        Design the architecture of your model (e.g., custom CNN, U-Net, FCN).
        Implement the model using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

3.    Training:
        Train the model on your training dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
        Use data augmentation to improve generalization.

4.    Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model on the validation and test sets using metrics like IoU, precision, and recall.
        Fine-tune the model based on the evaluation results.

5.    Deployment:
        Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images.
